# CLAUDE.md — darknessALP

## Purpose
Teaching codebase. The student audience is the primary constraint on every decision.

## Language
- Vanilla Python 3.10+ only. No third-party packages unless unavoidable and approved.
- Standard library first. If you reach for `numpy`, stop and ask.

## Style — strict PEP 8
- 79-char line limit.
- `snake_case` for everything (variables, functions, files). `UPPER_SNAKE` for module-level constants only.
- One blank line between logical blocks inside a function; two between top-level definitions.
- Run mentally through PEP 8 before proposing any code.

## File / module layout
- One function per file where practical. Files live in `src/darknessalp/`.
- File name = function name (e.g. `compute_orbit.py` contains `compute_orbit()`).
- `__init__.py` re-exports the public API; nothing else.
- Tests mirror the source: `tests/test_compute_orbit.py` tests `compute_orbit()`.

## Code length
- Minimise character count. No padding, no boilerplate prose.
- Docstrings: one short line — what it returns, not how it works.
- Comments: one brief phrase; never a sentence that restates the code.
- No blank placeholder comments, no TODO blocks, no verbose error messages.

## I/O and arguments
- Scripts that run standalone use `argparse` — brief `help=` strings only.
- Print output only when the user asked for output. No debug prints left in.
- File paths come in as arguments; never hardcoded.

## What to avoid
- Clever one-liners that sacrifice readability. Students read this.
- Deep nesting. Flatten with early returns.
- Classes unless state genuinely needs to travel. Functions first.
- Abstract base classes, decorators, metaclasses — not in this repo.
- Type annotations are optional; add them only if they clarify, not clutter.
